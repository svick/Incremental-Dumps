short term:
- don't write empty unsaved indexes
- compression of metadata and indexes
- better (group) compression of diff dumps
 - one group for id and dd (no compressing twice)
- idumps r to stdout
- std::
- encapsulate public fields? (e.g. in WritableDump)
- deal with Readable/WritableDump
- extract base36 code from DumpRevision
- do something with build process

long term:
